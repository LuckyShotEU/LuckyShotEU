## Hello, my name is Thomas. I've recently started my education at AspITðŸ‘‹
I really like to dive deep into history and I know quite a lot about ww2 in particular. I enjoy Counter-Strike and I love playing football. I'm 23 years old and I live by myself in Denmark.
I've recently gotten an interest in web design and working more with computers, although I'm still very green.
